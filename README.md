# Getting started with Python for data science
These are few of my projects which I completed with while getting started with Data Science from GreyAtom.

These are based on concepts such as:
1. Basics of Python
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Statistics
6. Probability
   and their various techniques.
